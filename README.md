Vicarious is a location-based and 360 wrapper for equirectangular images. It uses the Google Maps API to provide coordinates to Flickr for an image search, then renders them using the A-Frame library.

### What's equirectangular?

In short, it's a fancy panorama with a 2:1 width-to-heigh ratio that's wrap-able into a "photo sphere" of sorts.
